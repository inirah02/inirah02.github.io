**Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Machine Learning  
**Duration:** January 2023 - March 2023  
**Grant:** $1000 USD from Google KaggleX

## Overview

Developed an end-to-end pipeline restaurant recommendation system optimizing suggestions based on cost, ratings, cuisine, and location.

## Funding & Recognition

Secured an educational grant of **$1000** from **Google KaggleX** and participated in a 4-month global technical mentorship program.

## Key Features

- Multi-constraint optimization (cost, ratings, cuisine, location)
- Real-time data collection mechanisms
- Advanced ML algorithms for personalization

## Technical Approach

- **K-Means Clustering** for data segmentation
- **TF-IDF** for text feature extraction
- **Collaborative Filtering** for user-based recommendations
- **Cosine Similarity** for content-based filtering
- **Feature Engineering** to improve model performance
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) to gain insights into restaurant attributes

## Impact

Addressed issues faced by students and culinary entrepreneurs by providing data-driven restaurant recommendations with multiple constraint factors.
